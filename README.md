# PF2e-Target-Damage

A quality of life module that makes applying damage to targets easier in the Pathfinder 2e system.
A direct successor to [target-lock](https://github.com/WillNichols726/target-lock), which most of the buttons code originates from. The changes include:
- Updating to V10
- Setting to hide non-player owned targets
- Abiding by "Tokens determine NPC name visibility" system setting
- Selecting the target by hovering or clicking over name in chat
- Splash Damage Selection
